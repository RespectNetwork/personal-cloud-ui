								</p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Incorporation of
								the Respect Trust Framework</span>.&nbsp;These Terms of
								Service (Terms) incorporate by reference the Respect Trust Framework
								listed with the Open Identity Exchange at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://openidentityexchange.org/trust-frameworks/respect-trust-framework">http://openidentityexchange.org/trust-frameworks/respect-trust-framework</a>.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:left">A one-page summary of the five Respect Principles (Promise,
								Permission, Protection, Portability, Proof) at the core of the Respect
								Trust Framework is available at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://respectnetwork.com/respect-trust-framework">http://respectnetwork.com/respect-trust-framework</a>.
								The purpose of the Respect Trust Framework is to define a simple set of
								principles and rules to which all Members of a digital trust network
								agree so that they may share identity and personal data with greater
								confidence that it will be protected and only used as authorized. All
								Members of the Respect Network, including The Cynja, agree to the
								Global Terms of the Respect Trust Framework, provided that such
								participation does not preclude Members from pursuing claims outside of
								the scope of the Respect Trust Framework through other means.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Definitions.</span>&nbsp;All
								capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined in this document are
								defined in the Respect Trust Framework, available at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://respectnetwork.com/respect-trust-framework">http://respectnetwork.com/respect-trust-framework</a>.&nbsp;</p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Global and Local
								Terms.</span>&nbsp;The purpose, principles, and rules of
								the Respect Trust Framework comprise the Global Terms. These Terms of
								Service together with the&nbsp;The Cynja&nbsp;Privacy
								Policy comprise the Local Terms that apply specifically to your
								relationship with&nbsp;The Cynja.&nbsp;The Respect Trust
								Framework requires that any Local Terms, such as these Terms of
								Service, not conflict with the Global Terms. If any such Local Terms
								conflict with the Global Terms then the Global Terms shall prevail.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scope:</span>&nbsp;These
								Terms of Service (Terms) govern your use of and access to the Respect
								Network (Network); to The Cynja&nbsp;websites, APIs, and other
								personal networking services (collectively referred to as Services);
								and to any Member Data or other content.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Acceptance:</span>&nbsp;The Cynja's Services are dependent on every Members agreement to and
								observance of these standard Terms. This cooperation is critical to the
								functioning and accountability of the Respect Network. The more
								consistently that Members of the Network act with these Terms, the
								greater the benefit of the Network to every Member. Accordingly, it is
								a pre-condition to your access to and use of the Services that you
								accept and comply with the requirements, conditions, notices, and
								disclaimers contained in these Terms, including by reference the
								Respect Trust Framework. The acceptance and agreement to be bound by
								these Terms is indicated in either of two ways; by your registration
								with&nbsp;The Cynja&nbsp;and formal agreement to these
								Terms, or by your accessing or using the Services.&nbsp;</p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refunds:</span>&nbsp;Members
								of The Cynja can request refunds if requested within 30 days from
								the date of purchase. Please contact<a href="mailto:info@thecynja.com.com">&nbsp;info@thecynja.com</a>
								to initiate the request for a refund.&nbsp;</p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sections:</span>&nbsp;For
								purposes of readability only, the Terms are listed in the following
								sections. Please read all Terms carefully.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:left">1. Membership Requirements and Accountability<br>
								2. Security and Access Control<br>
								3. Privacy and Communications<br>
								4. Member Data and Intellectual Property<br>
								5. Other Legal Terms<br>
								6. Modifications<br>
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Membership
								Requirements and Accountability</span></big></big><br style="font-weight: bold;">
								<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Membership
								Eligibility</span><br>
								As a Member, you represent that you understand that you are only
								permitted to use the Services if you are a legal person that can form a
								binding contract with The Cynja, and that you are not a person that
								is prohibited from using or receiving the Services under the laws of
								the United States or other applicable jurisdiction.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lawful Use</span><br>
								You may only use the Services in compliance with these Terms and all
								applicable local, state, national, and international laws. You warrant
								and represent that you will use the Respect Network and&nbsp;The Cynja&nbsp;Services for lawful purposes only.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">One-Person-One-Account</span><br>
								As required by the Accountability section of the Respect Reputation
								System, you agree that your Member Account must be correlated with a
								single legal person (natural or statutory), and that each legal person
								may register only one Member Account. You understand and acknowledge
								that maintaining this One-Person-One-Account Rule is essential to
								maintaining the integrity of the Respect Network, and the Respect Trust
								Framework.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Personas</span><br>
								You agree that when the Respect Network incorporates support for
								pseudonymous or anonymous Personas, you will be responsible for any and
								all Personas associated with your Member Account, including voting for
								Amendments to the Respect Trust Framework, or any other action that
								represents your official action through a Persona on the Network.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sole
								Responsibility for Individual Member Account</span><br>
								Use of an Individual Member Account is expressly limited to you as a
								natural person. Your Individual Member Account may not be transferred
								or shared with any other party, temporarily or permanently.
								We recommend that you treat access to your account as you would treat
								your signature; it is the foundation for your personal brand on the
								Respect Network. You agree to bear sole responsibility for all use of
								your Member Account, and for the confidentiality of your authentication
								credentials, including your use of authentication services from
								third-party social networks or sites (herein jointly referred to as
								Social Login Services).
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">No Impersonation</span><br>
								You represent and guarantee that all Member Data you provide
								to&nbsp;The Cynja&nbsp;at the time of registration and
								thereafter is accurate, and agree not to impersonate any person or
								entity, not to falsely represent your affiliation with any person or
								entity, and not to otherwise provide the personal information of any
								third party or any fictitious person or attribute as part of the
								registration process or thereafter.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">No Name Squatting</span><br>
								You must be a legal representative of the legal entity represented by
								a&nbsp;The Cynja&nbsp;Member Account in order to register a
								Member Account. You may not engage in squatting on Member Account
								names. Squatting is herein defined as the procurement of Member
								Accounts with the intention of later trading in their use or control
								for value.
								To help prevent squatting, Member accounts that are inactive for more
								than 6 months without notice to The Cynja&nbsp;may be suspended
								or cancelled without further notic e.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Termination of
								Your Account</span><br>
								If, in&nbsp;The Cynja&nbsp;sole discretion, you have
								violated these Terms,&nbsp;The Cynja&nbsp;may take
								necessary measures to remedy your violation, including terminating your
								ability to access the Respect Network system, and/or suspending and/or
								terminating your Membership. If&nbsp;The Cynja&nbsp;terminates your account, we shall enable export of
								Member Data that you sourced or shared on the Respect Network
								consistent with the requirements of the Respect Trust Framework unless:
								a) we are constrained from doing so by a court order or other legal
								action, or b) it can be reasonably shown that this action would enable
								you or others to violate or circumvent these Local Terms or the Global
								Terms of the&nbsp;Respect Trust Framework.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Security
								and Access Control</span>
								</big></big></p>
								<p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">No Unauthorized
								Access</span><br>
