Project Description
-------------------

Personal Cloud is attributing ownership of information to the person as opposed to taking ownership of information away from the person.In a Personal Cloud, the individual controls the information and the processes that operate on the information.Personal Cloud can be described as a virtual entity, which can do one or more of the following things
1.	Enable a person to store and share information with other entities – real or virtual — with appropriate permissions
2.	Create software agents which can process information on behalf of the person
3.	Create multiple personas or identities with different access rights and visibility rules.
4.	Interact with other entities in the web safely and effectively.
Another important aspect of a Personal Cloud is to play the role of an agent or a proxy for a person. In today’s world where we are swimming in an ocean of information, it’s important to filter, organize and correlate bits and pieces of information and extract actionable intelligence.
